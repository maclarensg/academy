Answer this question:
Item A = $0.10
Item B = $3
Item C = $6

I have a budget $100. I want to buy a total of 100 items.

Challenge #1: How many of A, B and C should I buy?

Challenge #2: (For computer programmers only) Write an algorithm to solve the above. It should also work when the cost of items, budget and total count changes. The budget and total count need not be the same number, e.g. what if I had $100 and needed 150 items? It should only need to handle 3 items.
